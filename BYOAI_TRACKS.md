- **User-Friendly CLI:** Commands for searching, listing, installing, and updating models.
- **Model Repository and Index:** A centralized repository with an index of available models and their metadata.
- **Modular Architecture:** Support for bundling multiple models together and optimizing them for different hardware configurations.
- **Community Contributions:** A system where users can contribute new models to the repository, ensuring quality and compatibility.
- **Educational:** Helps users understand how different AI models work.
- **Versatile:** Allows users to mix and match different models for unique applications.

## Example BYOAI Tracks

### BYOAI Track: Text-to-Speech with Coqui TTS

**Objective:** Convert text to speech using Coqui TTS model.

**Steps:**

1. **Install Coqui TTS Model:**
   - Open your terminal.
   - Run the following command to install the Coqui TTS model:
     `python byoai-core/byoai-cli.py install coqui_tts`

2. **Prepare Your Text Input:**
   - Create a text file with the content you want to convert to speech.
   - For example, create a file named `input.txt` and add the following text:
     `echo "Hello, welcome to BYOAI!" > input.txt`

3. **Run the Text-to-Speech Model:**
   - Use the installed Coqui TTS model to convert the text to speech.
   - Run the following command:
     `python modules/coqui_tts/coqui_tts.py input.txt output.wav`

4. **Play the Output Audio:**
   - Play the generated audio file.
   - For Linux, you can use:
     `aplay output.wav`
   - For Windows, you can use:
     `start output.wav`
   - For macOS, you can use:
     `afplay output.wav`

**Expected Outcome:** You should hear the text "Hello, welcome to BYOAI!" spoken out loud.

**Tips:**
- Change the input text by modifying the `input.txt` file.
- Explore different voices and settings in Coqui TTS for varied results.

### BYOAI Track: Image Classification with MobileNet

**Objective:** Classify images using the MobileNet model.

**Steps:**

1. **Install MobileNet Model:**
   - Open your terminal.
   - Run the following command to install the MobileNet model:
     `python byoai-core/byoai-cli.py install mobilenet_v2`

2. **Prepare Your Image Input:**
   - Ensure you have an image file you want to classify.
   - For example, `image.jpg`.

3. **Run the Image Classification Model:**
   - Use the installed MobileNet model to classify the image.
   - Run the following command:
     `python modules/mobilenet_v2/mobilenet_v2.py image.jpg`

4. **View the Classification Result:**
   - The classification result will be displayed in the terminal.

**Expected Outcome:** The terminal will display the classification result of the image.

**Tips:**
- Use different images to test the model's accuracy.
- Explore different versions of MobileNet for varied results.
