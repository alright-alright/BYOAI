## Overview

Today, we made significant progress on the BYOAI project by enhancing the menu system, refining the CLI commands, and ensuring that users can effectively interact with bundled models. 

## Accomplishments

1. **Menu System Enhancements**: 
    - Created a robust main menu with options for Project Management, Model Management, Training & Deployment, BYOAI Terminal, Settings, and Help.
    - Implemented submenus for each main menu option to provide more detailed functionalities.
    - Added the ability to list, search, and bundle models within the Model Management menu.

2. **CLI Commands**:
    - Integrated commands to list and bundle models using the inquirer library for enhanced user interaction.
    - Implemented logging to track user actions and assist with debugging.

3. **User Interaction**:
    - Enabled multiple selections for bundling models, streamlining the process of selecting and bundling multiple models at once.
    - Ensured the CLI provides feedback and allows users to navigate back to the main menu from any point.

## Next Steps

- **Enhance Menu System**:
    - Add colors to selection choices for better visual feedback.
    - Implement a method for users to return to the main menu from any submenu easily.

- **Improve CLI Functionality**:
    - Ensure that users can effectively interact with bundled models and perform tasks such as installation and usage of models.
    - Plan and implement model optimization for different platforms to enhance the performance and compatibility of bundled models.

- **Documentation**:
    - Keep the documentation updated with recent changes and enhancements to the system.
    - Ensure clear instructions are provided for all functionalities to facilitate user understanding and usage.

- **File System Hierarchy**:
    - Re-evaluate and potentially update the initial proposal for the file system hierarchy to align with recent menu changes and new functionalities.

By focusing on these areas, we aim to create a more robust, user-friendly, and functional BYOAI system that meets our project's goals and vision.
